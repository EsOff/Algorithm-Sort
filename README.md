# Algorithm-Sort

## All source code in here are related to very basic algorithms. Intents to create this repository are:
1. Learn how to use Git and GitHub.
2. Manage personal study code in cloud.
3. Learn from each other.

## Problem Sorting Solutions.
1. Insertion Sort
  1) Average case - O(n2)
  2) Worst case   - O(n2)
2. Binary Insertion Sort
  1) Average case - O(n2)
3. Merge Sort
  1) Best case    - O(n) or O(n log n)
  2) Average case - O(n log n)
  3) Worst case   - O(n log n)
4. Quick Sort
  1) Average case - O(n log n)
  2) Worst case   - O(n2)
5. Shell Sort
  1) Average case - O(N^{3/2}) Frank & Lazarus, 1960[6]
